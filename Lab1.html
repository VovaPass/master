<div class="line-block">In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R programming language.</div>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=== | 3% | If at any point you’d like more information on a particular topic related to R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which | will open a menu of resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on your setup). Alternatively, a | simple web search often yields the answer you’re looking for.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====== | 5% | In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>5+7 [1] 12</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent job!</div>
<p>|========= | 8% | R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming language and often the reason we use a programming | language as opposed to a calculator is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============= | 11% | In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need | it, we can just create a new variable that stores the result.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================ | 13% | The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment operator, which is just a ‘less than’ symbol followed | by a ‘minus’ sign. It looks like this: &lt;-</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================== | 16% | Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on the right side of the arrow to the variable name | on the left side of the arrow.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================== | 18% | To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x &lt;- 5 + 7. This can be read as ‘x gets 5 plus 7’. Give it | a try now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x &lt;- 5 + 7</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are doing so well!</div>
<p>|========================= | 21% | You’ll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use the assignment operator, R assumes that you don’t | want to see the result immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for something else later on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================ | 24% | To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x [1] 12</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent job!</div>
<p>|=============================== | 26% | Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y = x - 3</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice try, but that’s not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Type y &lt;- x - 3 and press Enter. Whether you use x - 3 or x-3 is personal preference, but it’s good habit to include a space<br>
on either side of the assignment operator.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y &lt; x - 3 [1] FALSE</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Not quite right, but keep trying. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Type y &lt;- x - 3 and press Enter. Whether you use x - 3 or x-3 is personal preference, but it’s good habit to include a space<br>
on either side of the assignment operator.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y &lt;- x - 3</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You nailed it! Good job!</div>
<p>|================================== | 29% | What is the value of y? Type y to find out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y [1] 9</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Great job!</div>
<p>|====================================== | 32% | Now, let’s create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object that contains data is called a data structure and | numeric vectors are the simplest type of data structure in R. In fact, even a single number is considered a vector of length | one.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================= | 34% | The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for ‘concatenate’ or ‘combine’. To create a vector | containing the numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable called z.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x &lt;- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Inputting z &lt;- c(1.1, 9, 3.14) will assign the vector (1.1, 9, 3.14) to a new variable called z. Including single spaces after<br>
the commas in the vector is not required, but helps make your code less cluttered and more readable.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z &lt;- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice work!</div>
<p>|============================================ | 37% | Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R’s built-in help files via the <code>?</code> command. For | example, if you want more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that normally follow a function | name. Give it a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>? + + c() ? + ?c Error in help.search(“c”, fields = c(“?”, “c()”), package = NULL) : incorrect field specification</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?c</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice work!</div>
<p>|=============================================== | 39% | Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the output.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Your dedication is inspiring!</div>
<p>|================================================== | 42% | You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don’t | assign this vector to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z &lt;- 555</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Keep trying! Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Type c(z, 555, z). Don’t create a new variable. We just want to view the result.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(z, 555, z) [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14 555.00 1.10 9.00 3.14</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent work!</div>
<p>|===================================================== | 45% | Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z * 2 + 100 [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it!</div>
<p>|======================================================== | 47% | First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element to get the result you see above.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================ | 50% | Other common arithmetic operators are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>^</code> (where x^2 means ‘x squared’). To take the square root, use the | sqrt() function and to take the absolute value, use the abs() function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================================== | 53% | Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_sqrt &lt;- sqrt(z - 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|================================================================== | 55% | Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it contains?</p>
<p>1: a vector of length 0 (i.e.&nbsp;an empty vector) 2: a vector of length 3 3: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)</p>
<p>Selection: 1</p>
<div class="line-block">Almost! Try again.</div>
<div class="line-block">Think about how R handled the other ‘vectorized’ operations: element-by-element.</div>
<p>1: a vector of length 3 2: a vector of length 0 (i.e.&nbsp;an empty vector) 3: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<div class="line-block">Almost! Try again.</div>
<div class="line-block">Think about how R handled the other ‘vectorized’ operations: element-by-element.</div>
<p>1: a vector of length 0 (i.e.&nbsp;an empty vector) 2: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1) 3: a vector of length 3</p>
<p>Selection: 3</p>
<div class="line-block">You got it!</div>
<p>|===================================================================== | 58% | Print the contents of my_sqrt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_sqrt [1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</div>
<p>|======================================================================== | 61% | As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then took the square root of each element. This leaves | you with a vector of the same length as the original vector z.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================================================== | 63% | Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by my_sqrt.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_div &lt;- z/my_sqrt</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|============================================================================== | 66% | Which statement do you think is true?</p>
<p>1: my_div is undefined 2: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1) 3: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on…</p>
<p>Selection: Enter an item from the menu, or 0 to exit Selection: 3</p>
<div class="line-block">Great job!</div>
<p>|================================================================================= | 68% | Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_div [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it!</div>
<p>|===================================================================================== | 71% | When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified arithmetic operation (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, etc.) | element-by-element. If the vectors are of different lengths, R ‘recycles’ the shorter vector until it is the same length as | the longer vector.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================================================================== | 74% | When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3, but technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of | length 1.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================================================================== | 76% | Behind the scenes, R is ‘recycling’ the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make a vector of 100s. In other words, when | you ask R to compute z * 2 + 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================================== | 79% | To see another example of how this vector ‘recycling’ works, try adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don’t worry about saving | the result in a new variable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10) [1] 1 12 3 14</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are quite good my friend!</div>
<p>|================================================================================================= | 82% | If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of the longer vector, R will still apply the | ‘recycling’ method, but will throw a warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================================================================================== | 84% | Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) [1] 1 12 103 4</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are doing so well!</div>
<p>|======================================================================================================= | 87% | Before concluding this lesson, I’d like to show you a couple of time-saving tricks.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================================================================================== | 89% | Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let’s pretend that you made a mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead | of 100. You could either re-type the expression, or…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================================================== | 92% | In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard | until you get to this command (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow doesn’t work for you, just | type the corrected command.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(z * 2 + 100) [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">If your environment does not support the up arrow feature, then just type the corrected command to move on.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(z * 2 + 1000) [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Not quite right, but keep trying. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">If your environment does not support the up arrow feature, then just type the corrected command to move on.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z * 2 + 1000 [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s the answer I was looking for.</div>
<p>|================================================================================================================= | 95% | Finally, let’s pretend you’d like to view the contents of a variable that you created earlier, but you can’t seem to remember | if you named it my_div or myDiv. You could try both and see what works, or…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================================================================================================== | 97% | You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming | environments will provide a list of variables that you’ve created that begin with ‘my’. This is called auto-completion and can | be quite handy when you have many variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn’t work for you, just | type my_div and press Enter.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_div [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460</p>

<div class="line-block">In this lesson, you’ll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin to explore the relationship between your<br>
workspace and the file system of your machine.</div>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=== | 3% | Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like file paths, the outputs of these | commands may vary across machines.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====== | 5% | However it’s important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of commands) for interacting with files, that way | your code will work across different kinds of computers.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========= | 8% | Let’s jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions work!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============ | 10% | Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory using getwd().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>getwd() [1] “/Users/vladimir”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice work!</div>
<p>|=============== | 13% | List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ls() [1] “my_div” “my_sqrt” “temp_dir” “x” “y” “z”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent job!</div>
<p>|================== | 15% | Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating systems are | based on an operating system called Unix. It’s always a good idea to learn more about Unix!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===================== | 18% | Assign 9 to x using x &lt;- 9.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x &lt;- 9</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice work!</div>
<p>|======================== | 21% | Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ls() [1] “my_div” “my_sqrt” “temp_dir” “x” “y” “z”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent job!</div>
<p>|=========================== | 23% | List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir().</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>list.files() [1] “# app.py” “app.py” “Applications” “Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2”<br>

<div class="line-block">In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create sequences of numbers in R.</div>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===== | 4% | The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the <code>:</code> operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>1:20 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it!</div>
<p>|========== | 9% | That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also use it to create a sequence of real numbers. For | example, try pi:10.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>pi:10 [1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|================ | 13% | The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142…) and increasing in increments of 1. The upper limit of 10 is | never reached, since the next number in our sequence would be greater than 10.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===================== | 17% | What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>15:1 [1] 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|========================== | 22% | It counted backwards in increments of 1! It’s unlikely we’d want this behavior, but nonetheless it’s good to know how it could | happen.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================== | 26% | Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you can access its documentation with a question mark | followed by the function name: ?function_name_here. However, in the case of an operator like the colon used above, you must | enclose the symbol in backticks like this: ?<code>:</code>. (NOTE: The backtick (`) key is generally located in the top left corner of a | keyboard, above the Tab key. If you don’t have a backtick key, you can use regular quotes.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================== | 30% | Pull up the documentation for <code>:</code> now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>: Error: unexpected ‘:’ in “:”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?: Error: unexpected ‘:’ in “?:”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>?<code>:</code></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|========================================= | 35% | Often, we’ll desire more control over a sequence we’re creating than what the <code>:</code> operator gives us. The seq() function serves | this purpose.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================== | 39% | The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the <code>:</code> operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(1, 20) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it!</div>
<p>|==================================================== | 43% | This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let’s say that instead we want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, | incremented by 0.5. seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(0, 10, by=0.5) [1] 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Great job!</div>
<p>|========================================================= | 48% | Or maybe we don’t care what the increment is and we just want a sequence of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) | does the trick. Give it a shot now and store the result in a new variable called my_seq.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(5, 10, length=30) [1] 5.000000 5.172414 5.344828 5.517241 5.689655 5.862069 6.034483 6.206897 6.379310 6.551724 6.724138 6.896552 [13] 7.068966 7.241379 7.413793 7.586207 7.758621 7.931034 8.103448 8.275862 8.448276 8.620690 8.793103 8.965517 [25] 9.137931 9.310345 9.482759 9.655172 9.827586 10.000000</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">You’re using the same function here, but changing its arguments for different results. Be sure to store the result in a new<br>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_seq &lt;- seq(5, 10, length=30)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are quite good my friend!</div>
<p>|============================================================== | 52% | To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function. Try it now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>length(my_seq) [1] 30</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are doing so well!</div>
<p>|=================================================================== | 57% | Let’s pretend we don’t know the length of my_seq, but we want to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to N, where N | represents the length of the my_seq vector. In other words, we want a new vector (1, 2, 3, …) that is the same length as | my_seq.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================================================== | 61% | There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine the <code>:</code> operator and the length() function like this: | 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>1:length(my_seq) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s the answer I was looking for.</div>
<p>|============================================================================== | 65% | Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq(along.with = my_seq) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice work!</div>
<p>|=================================================================================== | 70% | However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type | seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>seq_along(my_seq) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent work!</div>
<p>|======================================================================================== | 74% | There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly in R. Simple approaches that involve less typing | are generally best. It’s also important for your code to be readable, so that you and others can figure out what’s going on | without too much hassle.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================================= | 78% | If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it’s likely that function is highly optimized for that purpose and is your | best option. As you become a more advanced R programmer, you’ll design your own functions to perform tasks when there are no | better options. We’ll explore writing your own functions in future lessons.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================================== | 83% | One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which stands for ‘replicate’. Let’s look at a few uses.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|======================================================================================================= | 87% | If we’re interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>rep(0, times = 40) [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Great job!</div>
<p>|============================================================================================================= | 91% | If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go | ahead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10) [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">All that practice is paying off!</div>
<p>|================================================================================================================== | 96% | Finally, let’s say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 | zeros, then 10 ones, then 10 twos. We can do this with the <code>each</code> argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<div class="line-block">The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.</div>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=== | 3% | Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a | list may contain multiple data types. We’ll explore atomic vectors further before we get to lists.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====== | 5% | In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic | vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we’ll take a closer look at logical and character | vectors.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========= | 8% | Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for ‘not available’). These values are generated as the result of | logical ‘conditions’. Let’s experiment with some simple conditions.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============= | 11% | First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55, -10, and 6.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &lt;- 0.5, 55, -10, 6 Error: unexpected ‘,’ in “num_vect &lt;- 0.5,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &lt;- (0.5, 55, -10, 6) Error: unexpected ‘,’ in “num_vect &lt;- (0.5,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &lt;- (0.5 55 -10 6) Error: unexpected numeric constant in “num_vect &lt;- (0.5 55”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ls() [1] “my_div” “my_seq” “my_sqrt” “old.dir” “temp_dir” “x” “y” “z”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Recall that the c() function is used for creating a vector. If you forget how to use it, use ?c to access the help file. Don’t<br>
forget to assign the result to a new variable called num_vect.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &lt;- c(0.5 55 -10 6) Error: unexpected numeric constant in “num_vect &lt;- c(0.5 55”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &lt;- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Perseverance, that’s the answer.</div>
<p>|================ | 13% | Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect &lt; 1, which is read as ‘num_vect is less than 1’.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>tf &lt;- num_vect &lt; 1</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are quite good my friend!</div>
<p>|=================== | 16% | What do you think tf will look like?</p>
<p>1: a single logical value 2: a vector of 4 logical values</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<div class="line-block">All that hard work is paying off!</div>
<p>|====================== | 18% | Print the contents of tf now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>rt function (n, df, ncp) { if (missing(ncp)) .Call(C_rt, n, df) else rnorm(n, ncp)/sqrt(rchisq(n, df)/df) } &lt;bytecode: 0xbc6964190&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:stats&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Just type tf and press Enter to view the its value.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>tf [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</div>
<p>|========================= | 21% | The statement num_vect &lt; 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each corresponding element of our numeric vector num_vect | satisfies this condition.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================ | 24% | The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the statement 0.5 &lt; 1 is TRUE. The second element of | num_vect is 55, which is greater than 1, so the statement 55 &lt; 1 is FALSE. The same logic applies for the third and fourth | elements.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================== | 26% | Let’s try another. Type num_vect &gt;= 6 without assigning the result to a new variable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>num_vect &gt;= 6 [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent work!</div>
<p>|================================== | 29% | This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect is greater than OR equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are | greater than or equal to 6, the second and fourth elements of the result are TRUE and the first and third elements are FALSE.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====================================== | 32% | The <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> symbols in these examples are called ‘logical operators’. Other logical operators include <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code> for | exact equality, and <code>!=</code> for inequality.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================= | 34% | If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A | B (logical ‘or’ a.k.a. ‘union’) | or whether they are both TRUE with A &amp; B (logical ‘and’ a.k.a. ‘intersection’). Lastly, !A is the negation of A and is TRUE | when A is FALSE and vice versa.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================ | 37% | It’s a good idea to spend some time playing around with various combinations of these logical operators until you get | comfortable with their use. We’ll do a few examples here to get you started.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================== | 39% | Try your best to predict the result of each of the following statements. You can use pencil and paper to work them out if it’s | helpful. If you get stuck, just guess and you’ve got a 50% chance of getting the right answer!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================== | 42% | (3 &gt; 5) &amp; (4 == 4)</p>
<p>1: TRUE 2: FALSE</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<div class="line-block">Great job!</div>

<div class="line-block">All that hard work is paying off!</div>

<p>1: FALSE 2: TRUE</p>
<p>Selection: 2</p>
<div class="line-block">You are quite good my friend!</div>
<p>|============================================================ | 50% | Don’t worry if you found these to be tricky. They’re supposed to be. Working with logical statements in R takes practice, but | your efforts will be rewarded in future lessons (e.g.&nbsp;subsetting and control structures).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================================== | 53% | Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to distinguish character objects, as in the following | example.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================== | 55% | Create a character vector that contains the following words: “My”, “name”, “is”. Remember to enclose each word in its own set | of double quotes, so that R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in a variable called my_char.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_char &lt;- c(“My”, “name”, “is”)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|===================================================================== | 58% | Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_char [1] “My” “name” “is”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s correct!</div>
<p>|======================================================================== | 61% | Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Let’s say we want to join the elements of my_char together into one | continuous character string (i.e.&nbsp;a character vector of length 1). We can do this using the paste() function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=========================================================================== | 63% | Type paste(my_char, collapse = ” “) now. Make sure there’s a space between the double quotes in the <code>collapse</code> argument. | You’ll see why in a second.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(my_char, collapse = ” “) [1]”My name is”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</div>
<p>|============================================================================== | 66% | The <code>collapse</code> argument to the paste() function tells R that when we join together the elements of the my_char character | vector, we’d like to separate them with single spaces.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================= | 68% | It seems that we’re missing something…. Ah, yes! Your name!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|===================================================================================== | 71% | To add (or ‘concatenate’) your name to the end of my_char, use the c() function like this: c(my_char, “your_name_here”). Place | your name in double quotes where I’ve put “your_name_here”. Try it now, storing the result in a new variable called my_name.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>c(my_char, “your_name_here”) [1] “My” “name” “is” “your_name_here”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Tack your name on to the end of the my_char vector using the c() function. Be sure to assign the result to a new variable<br>
called my_name. If your name was “Swirl”, you would type my_name &lt;- c(my_char, “Swirl”).</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_name &lt;- c(my_char, “Vladimir”)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">All that hard work is paying off!</div>
<p>|======================================================================================== | 74% | Take a look at the contents of my_name.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_name [1] “My” “name” “is” “Vladimir”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are amazing!</div>
<p>|=========================================================================================== | 76% | Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together into a single character string. Don’t forget to | say collapse = ” “!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“my_nam”) [1] “my_nam”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Use paste(my_name, collapse = ” “) to join all four words together, separated by single spaces.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(my_name, collapse = ” “) [1]”My name is Vladimir”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent job!</div>
<p>|============================================================================================== | 79% | In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of a single character vector. paste() can also be used | to join the elements of multiple character vectors.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================================= | 82% | In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of length 1 (i.e.&nbsp;join two words). Try paste(“Hello”, | “world!”, sep = ” “), where the <code>sep</code> argument tells R that we want to separate the joined elements with a single space.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello”, + | “world!”, sep = ” “) Error: unexpected ‘|’ in:”paste(“Hello”, |”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello” | “world!”, sep = ” “) Error in”Hello” | “world!” : operations are possible only for numeric, logical or complex types</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello” “world!”, sep = ” “) Error: unexpected string constant in”paste(“Hello” “world!””</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello” “world!”, sep = ” “) Error: unexpected string constant in”paste(“Hello” “world!””</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello” “world!”, sep = ” “) Error: unexpected string constant in”paste(“Hello” “world!””</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(“Hello”,“world!”, sep = ” “) [1]”Hello world!”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s a job well done!</div>
<p>|==================================================================================================== | 84% | For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 | with the character vector c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”). This time, use sep = “” to leave no space between the joined elements.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(1:3, sep = ““) [1]”1” “2” “3”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You’re close…I can feel it! Try it again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Use paste(1:3, c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”), sep = ““) to see what happens when we join two vectors of equal length using paste().</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(1:3, c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”), sep = ““) [1]”1X” “2Y” “3Z”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You are amazing!</div>
<p>|======================================================================================================= | 87% | What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint: we talked about this in a previous lesson.)</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================================================================================== | 89% | Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = “-”), where LETTERS is a predefined variable in R containing a character | vector of all 26 letters in the English alphabet.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = “-”) [1] “A-1” “B-2” “C-3” “D-4” “E-1” “F-2” “G-3” “H-4” “I-1” “J-2” “K-3” “L-4” “M-1” “N-2” “O-3” “P-4” “Q-1” “R-2” “S-3” “T-4” [21] “U-1” “V-2” “W-3” “X-4” “Y-1” “Z-2”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Keep up the great work!</div>
<p>|============================================================================================================== | 92% | Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector 1:4, R simply recycles, or repeats, 1:4 until it matches | the length of LETTERS.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================================================================= | 95% | Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets ‘coerced’ into a character vector by the paste() function.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|==================================================================================================================== | 97% | We’ll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means is that the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the output above are | no longer numbers to R, but rather characters “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4”.</p>

<div class="line-block">Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis. Often, missing values must not be ignored, but rather<br>
they should be carefully studied to see if there’s an underlying pattern or cause for their missingness.</div>
<p>…</p>
<p>|====== | 5% | In R, NA is used to represent any value that is ‘not available’ or ‘missing’ (in the statistical sense). In this lesson, we’ll | explore missing values further.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============ | 10% | Any operation involving NA generally yields NA as the result. To illustrate, let’s create a vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) and assign | it to a variable x.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x &lt;- c(44, NA, 5, NA)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it right!</div>
<p>|================== | 15% | Now, let’s multiply x by 3.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>x * 3 [1] 132 NA 15 NA</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">All that hard work is paying off!</div>
<p>|======================== | 20% | Notice that the elements of the resulting vector that correspond with the NA values in x are also NA.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================== | 25% | To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing 1000 draws from a standard normal distribution with | y &lt;- rnorm(1000).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>y &lt;- rnorm(1000)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s a job well done!</div>
<p>|==================================== | 30% | Next, let’s create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z &lt;- rep(NA, 1000).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>z &lt;- rep(NA, 1000)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Excellent work!</div>
<p>|========================================== | 35% | Finally, let’s select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values (combining y and z) such that we don’t know how many NAs | we’ll wind up with or what positions they’ll occupy in our final vector – my_data &lt;- sample(c(y, z), 100).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_data &lt;- sample(c(y, z), 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">You got it!</div>
<p>|================================================ | 40% | Let’s first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data. The is.na() function tells us whether each element of a | vector is NA. Call is.na() on my_data and assign the result to my_na.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_na &lt;- is.na(“my_data”)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Not quite, but you’re learning! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.</div>
<div class="line-block">Assign the result of is.na(my_data) to the variable my_na.</div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_na &lt;- is.na(my_data)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">That’s the answer I was looking for.</div>
<p>|====================================================== | 45% | Now, print my_na to see what you came up with.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_na [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE [21] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE [41] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE [61] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE [81] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Great job!</div>
<p>|============================================================ | 50% | Everywhere you see a TRUE, you know the corresponding element of my_data is NA. Likewise, everywhere you see a FALSE, you know | the corresponding element of my_data is one of our random draws from the standard normal distribution.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|================================================================= | 55% | In our previous discussion of logical operators, we introduced the <code>==</code> operator as a method of testing for equality between | two objects. So, you might think the expression my_data == NA yields the same results as is.na(). Give it a try.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>my_data == NA [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [42] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [83] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</div>
<p>|======================================================================= | 60% | The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a value, but just a placeholder for a quantity that is not | available. Therefore the logical expression is incomplete and R has no choice but to return a vector of the same length as | my_data that contains all NAs.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|============================================================================= | 65% | Don’t worry if that’s a little confusing. The key takeaway is to be cautious when using logical expressions anytime NAs might | creep in, since a single NA value can derail the entire thing.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=================================================================================== | 70% | So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that has a TRUE for every NA and FALSE for every numeric | value, we can compute the total number of NAs in our data.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|========================================================================================= | 75% | The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as the number 1 and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, | if we take the sum of a bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of TRUEs.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>|=============================================================================================== | 80% | Let’s give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count the total number of TRUEs in my_na, and thus the total | number of NAs in my_data. Don’t assign the result to a new variable.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>sum(my_na) [1] 49</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">Nice work!</div>
<p>|===================================================================================================== | 85% | Pretty cool, huh? Finally, let’s take a look at the data to convince ourselves that everything ‘adds up’. Print my_data to the | console.</p>

<div class="line-block">Keep working like that and you’ll get there!</div>
<p>|=========================================================================================================== | 90% | Now that we’ve got NAs down pat, let’s look at a second type of missing value – NaN, which stands for ‘not a number’.
